# Project Vision

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-12

## Goal

Create a robust, accurate, and user-friendly PDF to Excel table extraction tool.
The tool should handle various PDF layouts, preserve formatting, and support batch processing.
It aims to be the "go-to" local solution for data extraction from PDF reports.

## Requirements

### Core Features (Table Stakes)
- Extract tables from single PDF to Excel.
- Batch process multiple PDFs.
- Preserve basic formatting (font, bold headers).
- Handle different table structures.

### Differentiators
- High accuracy on complex tables.
- Intelligent column type detection (dates, numbers).
- User-friendly CLI and potential GUI integration.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Python-based CLI tools.
- Local processing (no cloud dependencies).
- Standard PDF files (text-based).

**Out of Scope:**
- OCR for scanned images (unless using Tesseract locally later).
- Web-based service (for now).
